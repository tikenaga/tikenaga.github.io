There are both good and bad ways to ask technical questions. In this essay, I'll be looking at two specific questions asked on stackoverflow and analyze why I believe one is smart and one is not smart.

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63841209/js-innerhtml-not-displaying) is what I'd consider to be a smart way to ask a question. This person's title, "JS innerHTML not displaying," is not very descriptive, but it does explain that his problem is in Javascript and has to do with the innerHTML function not displaying properly, so a person would know what their problem is just from a quick glance. In the body of the post, they explain the purpose of their program which is to create some dynamic navbar. Then, they explain the problem they have with their innerHTML function. They explain what exactly isn't working in their program which is that the innerHTML is displaying in the console but not in the navbar. They also say that they have been console logging which shows that they have been trying to find what exactly is wrong with the program. 

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63840979/nested-query-2-array-object-javascript) is what I'd consider to be a not smart way to ask a question. First, this person doesn't make clear what exactly they are trying to ask. The title, "nested query 2 array object javascrip", is a just a cluster of words that have to do with what he is trying to ask, but the words don't even form a coherent sentence. Even in the body of the forum post, the questions he asks are hard to follow and aren't grammatically correct. I think that this person's first language isn't English and didn't make it clear that he doesn't speak the language well.
