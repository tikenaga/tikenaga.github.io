After spending time learning and implementing a UI Framework such as Semantic UI, it becomes abundantly obvious on why these sorts of frameworks are commonly used. As I said in a prior essay, I did take a class that focused a lot on HTML before dropping it. I mentioned back then that I found HTML to be clunky to use and I still stand by that statement, but after working with Semantic UI, I can see how HTML can be implemented to make better looking websites. IRaw HTML coding is just extremely hard to make something that looks appealing, and the investment to learning and implementing UI Frameworks is absolutely worth the trouble compared to using HTML and CSS to manually edit everything to look right. 

The benefits of using frameworks like Semantic UI is really just the amount of time and effort that is saved due to the many different functions and quality of life improvements to regular HTML and CSS functions. A really good exmaple is the grid function in Semantic UI. When making the grid in raw CSS, you'd have to specifically implement each column to fit into a three column grid, but in Semantic UI, you'd simply have to specify a "three column grid." The Framework takes out much of the hassle in these sorts of situations. Also, there really isn't a huge hassle in implementing something like Semantic UI in the first place since all you had to do is call the Sementic UI framework in the header section of the HTML code in three lines of code. The hassle is really just learning how to use the different functions of the framework, but as this class showed me, it really doesn't take a very long time to learn the basics. Plus, there are many different resources online to help people get their start in learning such a framework.
