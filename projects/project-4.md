During my time in ICS314, I was assigned many different projects that helped develop my programming and computer science skills. The project that I have spent the most time on and have learned the most in this class has been the final project for the semester. In this project, my group and I were tasked with creating a website application that could display and organize menus and restaurants for a user. We named our application Campus Cravings, and I felt this project was an incredible learning experience.

This project was a pretty huge undertaking and I had to manage my time well in order to complete my group's requirements for each deadline. My part in the project was mostly to build the databases that made up the foundation for the various functions of the web application. These databases were used to store various values such as all the restaurants, each restaurant's menu items, and each users favorite menu items. These databases allows my group to build the various webpages to display each restaurant's information and possibly edit them and add more of them. I felt that the hardest function to apply to this project was definitely the favorites function since I had to create some functionality in the application to make and remove a given database value with a click of a button. It was very interesting to create that functionality and rewarding when the app worked the way I envisioned it.

During this project, I learned many important skills in web development. The first thing I took away from this project is definitely the github elements in the project. I felt that github is an essential tool for any computer science major, and I learned more about its functionality especially in regard to group projects and how to establish and collaborate in groups. The final project in general was also a good testing grounds to use the various skills I developed through the semester in a practical application that people would use for everyday life.
