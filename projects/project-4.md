During my time in ICS314, I was assigned many different projects that helped develop my programming and computer science skills. The project that I have spent the most time on and have learned the most in this class has been the final project for the semester. In this project, my group and I were tasked with creating a website application that could display and organize menus and restaurants for a user. We named our application Campus Cravings, and I felt this project was an incredible learning experience.
