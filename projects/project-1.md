summary: A while ago, I did a big video editing project for my friends. 
---

In my old highschool Physics class, we had a fun group project to do, where we each had to create a video that has to correlate with some sort of subject that we were learning. My friends and I decided to take this project extremely seriously. My contributions to this project was that I was the only one who knew how to use video editing tools. I had to use Sony Vegas Pro as well as learn from scratch how to use certain tools in Adobe After Effects in order to finish this group project. This project displayed my ability to effectively collaborate with team members and to learn new tools quickly in order to accomplish the task on time. Sadly, I don't think I still have the video with me since it was on my old computer.
