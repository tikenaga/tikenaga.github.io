summary: A project to edit an existing videogame to create your own content
---

I'm a big fan of the Video Game series Fire Emblem. Within the community, there is a subset of people that have created tools that can be used to edit assets within some of the older games in the franchise. Using these tools, I have done various projects from creating new levels, art, and cutscenes into the game. This isn't a project that I'm extremely invested in and only really messed around with every now and then in my spare time.
