summary: Build a video game speedrunning goal and achieved it through research and practice
---


I'm not exactly sure if this counts as a project, but in 2016, I was interested in speedrunning and decided to run a obscure game from my childhood called Gotcha Force. It is a game with not much support from runners, and the record back then was years old and seemed beatable to me. I did some research on the game and found out some new application for a glitch in the game that allowed me a significant advantage to the old record, eventually beating it by 40 minutes. I ended up losing this record to many others that followed my discoveries and built upon them. 

I had to do a lot of research to pull this off. The glitch in question is not something that I can really describe well, but it basically allows you to write certain values within the game and create your own playable units out of thin air. I ended up stumbling upon this tool (that is the thumbnail picture) which allowed me and easier time finding the values that I needed to input in order to build what I wanted. After doing the research, I practiced the speedrun over and over again before I achieved the goal of beating the previous record.
